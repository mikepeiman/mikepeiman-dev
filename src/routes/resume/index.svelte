This is my resume. Needs a bit of work.

Items worth including:

- mikepeiman.dev: custom-built in Sveltekit w TailwindCSS, using GraphCMS cloud (now Hygraph) as CMS. Jan 2022
- super-tic-tac-toe: custom-built in Sapper; my most ambitious project thus far in terms of number of LOC (approx. 9,500) and features and UI. Dec 2019 - Jan 2020
- Discord clone: from an Egghead tutorial using React, I adapted it to SvelteKit framework.
